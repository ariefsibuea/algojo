/**
 * LeetCode Problem : Fruit Into Baskets
 * Topics           : Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window
 * Level            : Medium
 * URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets
 * Description      : You are given an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the i-th tree
 * 					produces. You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules
 * 					that you must follow:
 *                    - You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
 *                    - Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree
 * 						(including the start tree) while moving to the right.
 *                    - The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
 *                    - Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
 *                  Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
 * Examples         :
 * 					Example 1:
 * 					Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
 * 					Output: 3
 * 					Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
 *
 * 					Example 2:
 * 					Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
 * 					Output: 3
 * 					Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
 * 					If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
 *
 * 					Example 3:
 * 					Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
 * 					Output: 4
 * 					Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
 * 					If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
