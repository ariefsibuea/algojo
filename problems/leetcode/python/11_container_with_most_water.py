LeetCode Problem : Container With Most Water
Topic            : Array, Two Pointers, Greedy
Level            : Medium
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water
Description      : You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the
        two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form
        a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container
        can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
        Output: 49
        Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area
                of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

        Example 2:
        Input: height = [1,1]
        Output: 1
