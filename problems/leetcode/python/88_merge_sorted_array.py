LeetCode Problem : Merge Sorted Array
Topic            : Array, Two Pointers, Sorting
Level            : Easy
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/
Description      : You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers
        m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. Merge nums1 and nums2 into a
        single array sorted in non-decreasing order. The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,
        but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the
        first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should
        be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
        Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
        Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
                     The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

        Example 2:
        Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
        Output: [1]
        Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
                     The result of the merge is [1].

        Example 3:
        Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
        Output: [1]
        Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
                     The result of the merge is [1].
