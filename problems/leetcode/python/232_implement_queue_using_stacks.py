LeetCode Problem : Implement Queue using Stacks
Topic            : Stack, Design, Queue
Level            : Easy
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks
Description      : Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should
        support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty). Implement the MyQueue class with
        methods:
        - void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue
        - int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it
        - int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue
        - boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: ["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
               [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
        Output: [null, null, null, 1, 1, false]
        Explanation: MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
                     myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
                     myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
                     myQueue.peek(); // return 1
                     myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
                     myQueue.empty(); // return false
