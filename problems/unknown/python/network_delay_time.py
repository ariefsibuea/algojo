        """Finds the time it takes for all nodes to receive a signal using Bellman-Ford algorithm.

        This solution uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node
        to all other nodes in a weighted directed graph. The algorithm relaxes all edges for n-1
        iterations, where n is the number of nodes.

        Args:
            times: List of edges [u,v,w] where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes
                    for a signal to travel from u to v.
            n: The number of nodes in the network (labeled from 1 to n).
            k: The starting node to send the signal from.

        Returns:
            The time it takes for all nodes to receive the signal, or -1 if it's impossible.

        Time Complexity:
            O(E * V): Where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

        Space Complexity:
            O(V): For the distances array.
