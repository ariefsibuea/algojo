LeetCode Problem : First Bad Version
Topic            : Binary Search, Interactive
Level            : Easy
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/description
Description      : You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the
        latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous
        version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. Given n versions [1, 2, ..., n], you want to find
        out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool
        isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad.
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: n = 5, bad = 4
        Output: 4
        Explanation: call isBadVersion(3) -> false
                     call isBadVersion(5) -> true
                     call isBadVersion(4) -> true
                     Then 4 is the first bad version.

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 1, bad = 1
        Output: 1
