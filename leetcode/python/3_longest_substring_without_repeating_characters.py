LeetCode Problem : Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Topic            : Hash Table, String, Sliding Window
Level            : Medium
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters
Description      : Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
Examples         :
                    Example 1:
                    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
                    Output: 3
                    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

                    Example 2:
                    Input: s = "bbbbb"
                    Output: 1
                    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

                    Example 3:
                    Input: s = "pwwkew"
                    Output: 3
                    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
