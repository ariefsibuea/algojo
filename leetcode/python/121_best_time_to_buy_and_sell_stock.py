LeetCode Problem : Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Topic            : Array, Dynamic Programming
Level            : Easy

Description      : You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want
        to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to
        sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any
        profit, return 0.
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

        Example 2:
        Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
