LeetCode Problem : Climbing Stairs
Topic            : Math, Dynamic Programming, Memoization
Level            : Easy
URL              : https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/
Description      : You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or
        2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Examples         :
        Example 1:
        Input: n = 2
        Output: 2
        Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
        1. 1 step + 1 step
        2. 2 steps

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 3
        Output: 3
        Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
        1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
        2. 1 step + 2 steps
        3. 2 steps + 1 step

        Time Complexity:
