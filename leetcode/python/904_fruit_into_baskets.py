Description      : You are given an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the i-th tree produces.
                    You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you
                    must follow:
                        - You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
                        - Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree
                            (including the start tree) while moving to the right.
                        - The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
                        - Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
                    Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
Examples         :
                    Example 1:
                    Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
                    Output: 3
                    Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

                    Example 2:
                    Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
                    Output: 3
                    Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
                    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].

                    Example 3:
                    Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
                    Output: 4
                    Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
                    If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
