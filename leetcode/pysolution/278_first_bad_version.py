        Find first version where code broken by using binary search approach.
        Assuming the version order goes from 1 to n.
        Args:
            n: int representing the total number of versions
        Returns:
            int: the first bad version number
        Examples:
            n = 5, bad = 4 -> output = 4
            All versions from 4 onwards are bad
        Solutions:
            Binary Search
        Time Complexity:
            O(log n) - binary search halves search space each iteration
        Space Complexity:
            O(1) - only uses a constant amount of extra space
