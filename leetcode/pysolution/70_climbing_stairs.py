        Calculates the number of distinct ways to climb n stairs.
        You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
        In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
        Args:
            n (int): Number of stairs to climb, where 1 <= n <= 45
        Returns:
            int: Number of distinct ways to climb the stairs
        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.climbStairs(2)
            2  # Can climb: 1. 1+1 steps, 2. 2 steps
            >>> solution.climbStairs(3)
            3  # Can climb: 1. 1+1+1 steps, 2. 1+2 steps, 3. 2+1 steps
        Solution:
            Iterative approach, similar to memoization but we only need to memorize 2 latest result.
        Time Complexity:
            O(n) we iterate through the sequence n times
        Space complexity:
            O(1) we only use two variables regardless of input size
