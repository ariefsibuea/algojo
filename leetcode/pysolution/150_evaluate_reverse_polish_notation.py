        """
        Evaluates the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
        Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
        Division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
        It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid.
        Args:
            tokens (List[str]): An array of strings representing arithmetic expression in RPN
        Returns:
            int: Result of evaluating the expression
        Examples:
            >>> evalRPN(["2","1","+","3","*"])
            9
            >>> evalRPN(["4","13","5","/","+"])
            6
            >>> evalRPN(["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"])
            22
        Note:
            - 1 <= tokens.length <= 10^4
            - tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", "/" or an integer in range [-200, 200]
        Solution:
            Stack with manual operation
        Time Complexity:
            O(n) where each token is processed once.
        Space Complexity:
            O(n) where stack stores up to n/2 numbers in the worse case.
