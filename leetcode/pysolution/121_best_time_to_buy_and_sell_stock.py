        Given an array of prices representing stock prices where prices[i] is the price on day i,
        find the maximum profit you can achieve by choosing a single day to buy and a single day to sell.
        You must buy before selling. If no profit can be achieved, return 0.
        Args:
            prices (List[int]): Array of stock prices where prices[i] is the price on day i
        Returns:
            int: Maximum profit that can be achieved
        Example 1:
            Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
            Output: 5
            Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
            Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
        Example 2:
            Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
            Output: 0
            Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
        Solution:
            One-pass with tracking minimum
        Time Complexity:
            O(n) where n is the length of prices array
        Space Complexity:
            O(1) since we only use two variables
