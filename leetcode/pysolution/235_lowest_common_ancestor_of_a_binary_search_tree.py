        Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
        The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
        Args:
            root (TreeNode): The root node of the binary search tree
            p (TreeNode): First node to find ancestor for
            q (TreeNode): Second node to find ancestor for
        Returns:
            TreeNode: The lowest common ancestor node of p and q
        Example:
            Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
            Output: 6
            Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
        Solution:
            Iterative searching in binary search tree
        Time complexity:
            O(h) where h is the height of the tree
        Space complexity:
            O(1)
