        The algorithm is the Interval Scheduling algorithm, also commonly known as the Activity Selection algorithm.
        More specifically, it uses the Earliest Finish Time greedy strategy. This is a classic greedy algorithm used
        for scheduling and resource allocation problems. First, sort all intervals by their end time, then select the
        intervals that don't overlap with the previously selected one.

        Args:
            intervals (List[List[int]]): A list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a list [start, end].

        Returns:
            int: The minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to eliminate all overlaps.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If 'intervals' is empty.

        Time Complexity:
            O(n log n): Where n is the number of intervals, due to sorting.

        Space Complexity:
            O(1): As the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space.
