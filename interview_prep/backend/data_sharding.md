# Data Sharding

## Understanding Data Sharding

Data sharding takes the concept further - it's like having multiple separate libraries in different cities, each holding different books. Sharding involves splitting your data across multiple independent database servers or instances. Each shard is a completely separate database that holds a subset of your total data.

Unlike partitioning where everything stays in one system, sharding distributes data across multiple physical or logical database instances. Each shard operates independently and typically runs on different servers.

## When You Need Data Sharding

Sharding becomes necessary when a single database server can no longer handle your workload, regardless of how well you've optimized it. Here are the critical indicators:

**Scale Beyond Single Server Limits:** When your data or traffic exceeds what one database server can handle. If your application has grown to serve millions of users globally, and even the most powerful single database server struggles with the load, it's time to shard.

**Geographic Distribution:** When you need to serve users globally with low latency. A social media platform might shard user data by region - Asian users' data stored in Asian data centers, European users' data in European centers, and so on.

**High Availability Requirements:** When you need your system to survive server failures. With sharding, if one shard goes down, the others continue operating, ensuring partial system availability.

## Real-World Example: E-commerce Platform

**Sharding Scenario:** Your platform explodes in popularity and now serves 100 million users globally with millions of daily transactions. A single database server, even with partitioning, cannot handle this load. You implement user-based sharding:

- Shard 1 (US East server): Users with IDs 1-25 million
- Shard 2 (US West server): Users with IDs 25-50 million
- Shard 3 (Europe server): Users with IDs 50-75 million
- Shard 4 (Asia server): Users with IDs 75-100 million

Each shard is a completely independent database server. When user ID 15 million logs in, your application routes the request to Shard 1. When user ID 60 million (a European customer) browses products, the request goes to Shard 3, providing better latency for European users.
