This repository contains the practices I work on in my spare time, when Iâ€™m unemployed ðŸ˜¢, when I'm in the mood to learn, or exploring whatever idea comes into my head. It includes grinding problems on LeetCode/HackerRank, creating mini-projects, or writing simple functions Iâ€™d like to build. Most of the code is written in Go and Python.
