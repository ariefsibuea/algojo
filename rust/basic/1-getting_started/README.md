# Getting Started

## Notes

- Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.
- Create a project using `cargo new`.
- Build a project using `cargo build`.
- Build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- Build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo store it in the _target/debug_ directory.
